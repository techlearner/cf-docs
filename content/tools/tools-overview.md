## Deployment Tools

Cloud Foundry provides two tools for performing all the tasks associated with deploying and managing applications:

+ VMC, a command-line interface delivered as a Ruby Gem.
+ Extension to Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite (STS) if you use the Eclipse IDE to develop your Java applications.

Both tools provide the same functionality, so the decision of which one to use is based on what type of environment you prefer: command-line or graphical IDE.  You can, of course, use both tools for different tasks.

You use both tools in the same way whether you are deploying to the VMware-hosted PaaS Cloud Foundry or to your local Micro Cloud Foundry; the only difference is in the initial targetting step.

See [Installing VMC](/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) or [Installing the Cloud Foundry Eclipse Extension](/tools/STS/configuring-STS.html) for details on installing each tool.
