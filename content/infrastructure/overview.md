Cloud Foundry is a modern application platform built specifically to simplify the end-to-end development, deployment, and operation of cloud era applications.
Cloud Foundry orchestrates heterogeneous application services and applications built in multiple frameworks and automates deployment of applications and their underlying infrastructure across diverse cloud infrastructures.

There are three main delivery models for Cloud Foundry:

+ [Cloudfoundry.com](http://cloudfoundry.com/) is a full-function public Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) operated by VMware.

    Developers can use this multi-tenant PaaS environment to deploy and cloud-scale their applications in seconds, as well as manage their complete lifecycle.  The PaaS supports a number of programming languages and frameworks and provides a set of application services, such as database and messaging.

+  [Micro Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.com/micro) is a complete, downloadable instance of Cloud Foundry contained within a virtual machine on your desktop.

    As with the PaaS, it enables simplified development and testing of applications.
    This unique model allows you to build and test applications on your own computers and ensure that applications running locally will also run in production,
    without modification on any Cloud Foundry-based private or public cloud.  You can get started with Micro Cloud Foundry using [these steps](micro/installing-mcf.html)

+ [CloudFoundry.org ](http://cloudfoundry.org/) is an open-source project and community under Apache 2 license which enables you to inspect, evaluate and modify Cloud Foundry software based on your own needs, while also minimizing the risk of lock-in.  This model provides the highest degree of extensibility, allowing the community to extend and integrate Cloud Foundry with any framework, application service or infrastructure cloud.
